'''1. """You can use this class to represent how classy someone
or something is.
"Classy" is interchangable with "fancy".
If you add fancy-looking items, you will increase
your "classiness".
Create a function in "Classy" that takes a string as
input and adds it to the "items" list.
Another method should calculate the "classiness"
value based on the items.
The following items have classiness points associated
with them:
"tophat" = 2
"bowtie" = 4
"monocle" = 5
Everything else has 0 points.
Use the test cases below to guide you!"""

class Classy(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []


# Test cases
me = Classy()

# Should be 0
print me.getClassiness()

me.addItem("tophat")
# Should be 2
print me.getClassiness()

me.addItem("bowtie")
me.addItem("jacket")
me.addItem("monocle")
# Should be 11
print me.getClassiness()

me.addItem("bowtie")
# Should be 15
print me.getClassiness()


2.# Write a function called "show_excitement" where the string
# "I am super excited for this course!" is returned exactly
# 5 times, where each sentence is separated by a single space.
# Return the string with "return".
# You can only have the string once in your code.
# Don't just copy/paste it 5 times into a single variable!


def show_excitement():
    # Your code goes here!
    return ""

print show_excitement()

3.Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. So total fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.
Note: The bus seating capacity is 50. so the final fare amount should be 5500. You need to override the fare() method of a Vehicle class in Bus class.
Use the following code for your parent Vehicle class. We need to access the parent class from inside a method of a child class.
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name, mileage, capacity):
        self.name = name
        self.mileage = mileage
        self.capacity = capacity

    def fare(self):
        return self.capacity * 100

class Bus(Vehicle):
    pass

School_bus = Bus("School Volvo", 12, 50)
print("Total Bus fare is:", School_bus.fare())
Expected Output:
Total Bus fare is: 5500.0
4.: Rename key of a dictionary
Write a program to rename a key city to a location in the following dictionary.
Given:
sample_dict = {
  "name": "Kelly",
  "age":25,
  "salary": 8000,
  "city": "New york"
}
Expected output:
{'name': 'Kelly', 'age': 25, 'salary': 8000, 'location': 'New york'}

5. Given an array arr[] of integers. Find a peak element i.e. an element that is not smaller than its neighbors. 
Note: For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbor           
Example:
Input: array[]= {5, 10, 20, 15}
Output: 20
Explanation: The element 20 has neighbors 10 and 15, both of them are less than 20.
Input: array[] = {10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 67}
Output: 20 or 90
Explanation: The element 20 has neighbors 10 and 15, both of them are less than 20, similarly 90 has neighbors 23 and 67.
The following corner cases give a better idea about the problem. 
If the input array is sorted in a strictly increasing order, the last element is always a peak element. For example, 50 is peak element in {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}.
If the input array is sorted in a strictly decreasing order, the first element is always a peak element. 100 is the peak element in {100, 80, 60, 50, 20}.
If all elements of the input array are the same, every element is a peak element.
It is clear from the above examples that there is always a peak element in the input array.
6.Given an array and a number K where K is smaller than the size of the array. Find the Kâ€™th smallest element in the given array. Given that all array elements are distinct.
Examples:  
Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, K = 3 
Output: 7
Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, K = 4 
Output: 10 



7.Given an array of N integers, and a number sum, the task is to find the number of pairs of integers in the array whose sum is equal to sum.


Examples:  
Input:  arr[] = {1, 5, 7, -1}, sum = 6
Output:  2
Explanation: Pairs with sum 6 are (1, 5) and (7, -1).
Input:  arr[] = {1, 5, 7, -1, 5}, sum = 6
Output:  3
Explanation: Pairs with sum 6 are (1, 5), (7, -1) & (1, 5).         
Input:  arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1}, sum = 2
Output:  6
Explanation: Pairs with sum 2 are (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1).
Input:  arr[] = {10, 12, 10, 15, -1, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1}, sum = 11
Output:  9
Explanation: Pairs with sum 11 are (10, 1), (10, 1), (10, 1), (12, -1), (10, 1), (10, 1), (10, 1), (7, 4), (6, 5).

8.An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers.
Examples : 
Input: -12, 11, -13, -5, 6, -7, 5, -3, -6
Output: -12 -13 -5 -7 -3 -6 11 6 5

9.Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

 
Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
 

10.The product difference between two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) is defined as (a * b) - (c * d).
For example, the product difference between (5, 6) and (2, 7) is (5 * 6) - (2 * 7) = 16.
Given an integer array nums, choose four distinct indices w, x, y, and z such that the product difference between pairs (nums[w], nums[x]) and (nums[y], nums[z]) is maximized.
Return the maximum such product difference.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,6,2,7,4]
Output: 34
Explanation: We can choose indices 1 and 3 for the first pair (6, 7) and indices 2 and 4 for the second pair (2, 4).
The product difference is (6 * 7) - (2 * 4) = 34.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,2,5,9,7,4,8]
Output: 64
Explanation: We can choose indices 3 and 6 for the first pair (9, 8) and indices 1 and 5 for the second pair (2, 4).
The product difference is (9 * 8) - (2 * 4) = 64.

 
Constraints:
4 <= nums.length <= 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 104

11.A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
You are given an array of strings sentences, where each sentences[i] represents a single sentence.
Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.
 
Example 1:
Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
- The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
- The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
- The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.

Example 2:
Input: sentences = ["please wait", "continue to fight", "continue to win"]
Output: 3
Explanation: It is possible that multiple sentences contain the same number of words. 
In this example, the second and third sentences (underlined) have the same number of words.

 
Constraints:
1 <= sentences.length <= 100
1 <= sentences[i].length <= 100
sentences[i] consists only of lowercase English letters and ' ' only.
sentences[i] does not have leading or trailing spaces.
All the words in sentences[i] are separated by a single space.

12. Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.
Given a balanced string s, split it into some number of substrings such that:
Each substring is balanced.
Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

Example 2:
Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
Output: 2
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.
Example 3:
Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".

 
Constraints:
2 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is either 'L' or 'R'.
s is a balanced string.

13. Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
 
Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]

Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]

Example 3:
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]

 
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 104

14.Given a list of numbers of list, write a Python program to create a list of tuples having first element as the number and second element as the cube of the number. Example:
Input: list = [1, 2, 3]
Output: [(1, 1), (2, 8), (3, 27)]

Input: list = [9, 5, 6]
Output: [(9, 729), (5, 125), (6, 216)]

15.With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.

Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
